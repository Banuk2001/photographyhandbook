      <h3>Lighting</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Understanding light in photography depends on where the natural or
        artificial light source is placed. And more than anything, doing this
        has an impact on the final image. Lighting a subject from behind
        typically results in a flat photograph with little to no depth or
        contour.

        Natural light refers to the ambient light supplied by the sun or moon.
        Natural light is also taken to include lights you'd find naturally in
        the environment, such as street lights, lamps.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Artificial light, such as flash or studio lights, is usually a mixed and
        filtered light source, which means that it produces muted colors and
        soft details. However, artificial light is also controlled by the
        photographer, which means that it can be adjusted and customized
        according to the desired effect.

      <h5 class="text-center">Lighting methods</h5>
      <br />
      <h6>• Direct light</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-lg-4 col-lg-4">
          <img
            src="images/images (14).jpeg"
            alt=""
            width="100%"
            height="200"
            class="rounded"
          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Direct light is a light where no obstacle is between the light source
        and the subject. The light rays all go in the same direction and are
        completely rectilinear from their point of departure to their
        destination.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>• Side light</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-lg-4 col-lg-4">
          <img
            src="images/download (40).jpeg"
            alt=""
            width="100%"
            height="200"
            class="rounded"
          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Side lighting is light that falls on a subject at roughly ninety degrees
        to the camera. This means that one side of a subject will be lit and the
        other side will be in shadow. In terms of helping to convey a subject's
        shape and form this is ideal
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>• Back light</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-lg-4 col-lg-4">
          <img
            src="images/download (39).jpeg"

            width="100%"
            height="200"
            class="rounded"
          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Backlighting means that you compose your pictures so that the primary
        light source is behind your subject. This can add a unique atmosphere to
        your photos while emphasizing the subject. Backlight works as a dramatic
        effect that adds contrast and separates the subject from the background.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>• background light</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-lg-4 col-lg-4">

          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        A background light is used to illuminate the background area of a set.
        The background light will also provide separation between the subject
        and the background. Many lighting setups follow a three-point lighting
        or four-point lighting setup.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>• Top light</h6>
      <div class="row">

          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Top lighting when the source of light is above the object being shot.
        Bottom lighting – when it is below the object. Side lighting – when it
        is to the side. Front lighting – at the front, and back lighting or
        contra-jour, when the source of light is behind the object which we are
        shooting.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        A rim light is placed behind a subject that exposes the outline or rim
        of the subject with light. This lighting highlights the contours of a
        subject and creates a dramatic and mysterious effect.

      <h5>Key light</h5>
      <p>
        The key light is the primary or main source of illumination in a
        lighting setup. It's typically the brightest and most prominent light
        and is positioned to illuminate the subject from a specific direction.
        The purpose of the key light is to provide the primary illumination,
        define the subject's shape and features, and establish the overall mood
        or tone of the scene. The key light is often placed at a 45-degree angle
        from the camera and slightly above the subject to create dimension and
        shadows.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Fill light</h5>
      <p>
        The fill light is used to reduce the contrast created by the key light
        by filling in the shadows and providing a more even lighting on the
        subject. It's usually softer and less intense than the key light. The
        fill light helps to illuminate the areas that the key light may cast in
        shadow, creating a more balanced and natural appearance. The position
        and intensity of the fill light can be adjusted to control the level of
        shadowing and contrast in the scene.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ❖ There is always only one key light.<br />
        ❖ Fill light is always less light than key light.

      <h5 class="text-center">Modifiers for Studio Lighting</h5>
      <h6>1. Soft box</h6>
      <p>
        A soft box is a fabric-lined box with a diffuser panel in front of a
        light source. It produces soft, diffused light that minimizes harsh
        shadows and highlights. Soft boxes come in various shapes and sizes.
      </p>
      <h6>2. Umbrella:</h6>
      <p>
        Umbrellas are versatile and affordable modifiers that spread light and
        create a softer, more even illumination. They come in reflective
        (bounce) and shoot-through types.
      </p>
      <h6>3. Beauty Dish:</h6>
      <p>
        A beauty dish is a round, shallow, and flat reflective dish with a
        center-mounted light source. It provides a softer light compared to bare
        bulbs and creates a pleasing, slightly specular highlight in the eyes.
      </p>
      <h6>4. Reflector:</h6>
      <p>
        Reflectors bounce light back onto the subject, filling in shadows and
        reducing contrast. They come in various colors and finishes to produce
        different effects.
      </p>
      <h6>5. Grid:</h6>
      <p>
        A grid is a honeycomb-like structure that attaches to a modifier (e.g.,
        soft box, beauty dish) to narrow and control the light's spread,
        focusing it on a specific area.
      </p>
      <h6>6. Snoot:</h6>
      <p>
        A snoot is a tube-like accessory that narrows the light beam, creating a
        spotlight effect and allowing precise lighting control.
      </p>
      <h6>7. Barndoor:</h6>
      <p>
        Barndoors are adjustable flaps attached to the front of a light source,
        allowing you to shape and direct the light by controlling its spread.
      </p>
      <h6>8. Gel:</h6>
      <p>
        Gels are colored filters that can be placed over the light source to
        change the color temperature or create artistic lighting effects.
      </p>
      <h6>9. Honeycomb Grid:</h6>
      <p>
        Similar to a grid, a honeycomb grid is a grid made of hexagonal cells
        that narrows the light beam and provides directional control.
      </p>
      <h6>10. Diffusion Panel:</h6>
      <p>
        A diffusion panel is a translucent fabric or material placed in front of
        a light source to soften and spread the light, reducing harsh shadows
        and creating a more even illumination.

      <p>
        A flash is a device used in photography that produces a brief burst of
        light (typically lasting 1/1000 to 1/200 of a second) at a color
        temperature of about 5500 K [citation needed] to help illuminate a
        scene. A major purpose of a flash is to illuminate a dark scene. Other
        uses are capturing quickly moving objects or changing the quality of
        light. Flash refers either to the flash of light itself or to the
        electronic flash unit discharging the light. Most current flash units
        are electronic, having evolved from single-use flashbulbs and flammable
        powders. Modern cameras often activate flash units automatically.

        High-speed sync (HSS) allows you to sync the light from a flash when
        using a shutter speed faster than your camera's native sync. We know
        that most DSLRs have a native sync speed of 1/250th of a second.
        Anything faster is beyond the camera's ability to sync with flash.
