        A camera lens (also known as photographic lens or photographic
        objective) is an optical lens or assembly of lenses used in conjunction
        with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on
        photographic film or on other media capable of storing an image
        chemically or electronically. A camera lens consists of several lenses,
        which are called compound lens.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-center">Classification of camera lenses</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Camera lenses are mainly classified into two types.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        • Angle of view<br />
        • Focal length
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h5 class="text-center">Angle of view</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-lg-3 col-lg-6">
          <img
            src="images/l12_01.jpg"
            alt=""
            width="100%"
            height="300"
            class="rounded"
          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Describes how much of the scene in front of the camera will be captured
        by the camera's sensor. In slightly more technical terms, it is the
        angular extent of the scene captured on the sensor, measured diagonally.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 class="text-center">Focal length</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-lg-3 col-lg-6">

          />&nbsp;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The focal length of a lens is determined when the lens is focused at
        infinity. Lens focal length tells us the angle of view. How much of the
        scene will be captured and the magnification. How large individual
        elements will be. The longer the focal length, the narrower the angle of
        view and the higher the magnification.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Also, Camera lenses can be categorized based on various criteria,
          including their focal length, aperture, design, and purpose.</strong

        Coating is applied to both surfaces of the lens. There are two main
        types of coating: a single layer and multilayer (usually 3-5 layers). A
        multilayer coating effectively reduces reflected light that cannot be
        eliminated with a single layer coating and increases the transmittance
        of light.

        path. The filter can be of a square or oblong shape and mounted in a
        holder accessory, or, more commonly, a glass or plastic disk in a metal
        or plastic ring frame, which can be screwed into the front of or clipped
        onto the camera lens.
