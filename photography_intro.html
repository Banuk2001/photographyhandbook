      <h3>Introduction of photography</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Photography is the art of producing images digitally using a display or
        a light-sensitive medium, like photographic film. A lens is used in a
        time-lapse exposure to direct light from light-sensitive objects inside
        a camera, or to direct an emitted light image that is reflected or
        reflected. Incorporating an electronic diagram, this produces an
        electrical charge in a modern pixel, which is processed electronically
        and stored in a digital image file for later display or
        processing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h5>History of photography</h5>
      <p>
        &nbsp;The invention of the camera obscura, which provides an image of a
        scene, dates back to ancient China. The Greek mathematicians Aristotle
        and Euclid in BC. A camera obscura is described independently in rooms 5
        and 4. In the 6th AD city, the Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of
        Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Arab physicist Ibn Al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) also invented a
        camera obscura as well as the first true pinhole camera. The invention
        of the camera has been traced back to the work of Ibn Al-Haytham. While
        the effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been
        described earlier, Ibn Al-Haytham gave the first correct analysis of the
        camera obscura, including the first geometrical and quantitative
        descriptions of the phenomenon, and was the first to use a screen in a
        dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the surface could
        be projected onto a screen on the other side. He also first understood
        the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole, and performed
        early experiments with afterimages, laying the foundations for the
        invention of photography in the 19th century.
        <br />
        <br />
        Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camera obscure that are formed by
        dark caves on the edge of a sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will
        act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down
        image on a piece of paper. Renaissance painters used the camera obscura
        which, in fact, gives the optical rendering in color that dominates
        Western Art. It is a box with a small hole in one side, which allows
        specific light rays to enter, projecting an inverted image onto a
        viewing screen or paper.
        <br />
        <br />
        The birth of photography was then concerned with inventing means to
        capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura. Albertus
        Magnus (1193–1280) discovered silver nitrate, and Georg Fabricius
        (1516–1571) discovered silver chloride, and the techniques described in
        Ibn Al-Haytham’s Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive
        photographs using medieval materials. [citation needed]
        <br />
        <br />
        Daniele Barbaro described a diaphragm in 1566.Wilhelm Homberg described
        how light darkened some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694. The
        fiction book Giphantie, published in 1760, by French author Tiphaigne de
        la Roche, described what can be interpreted as photography.
        <br />
        <br />
        In June 1802, British inventor Thomas Wedgwood made the first known
        attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura by means of a
        light-sensitive substance. He used paper or white leather treated with
        silver nitrate. Although he succeeded in capturing the shadows of
        objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight, and even made shadow
        copies of paintings on glass, it was reported in 1802 that "the images
        formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to
        produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver."
        The shadow images eventually darkened all over
      </p>
      <h5>Invention of photography</h5>
      <p>
        Photography was invented by Frenchman Nicéphore Niepce in 1822. Niepce
        developed a technique called heliography, which he used to create the
        world's oldest surviving photograph, View from the Window at Le Gras
        (1827). Heliography was conceived in response to camera obscura theories
        dating back to ancient history.

        In the 4th Century BC, Aristotle described the principles of the camera
        obscura, which involves projecting an image through a small hole.
        Through a camera obscura's pinhole, the image of the world is reversed
        or upside-down

        Niepce called his process heliography, from the Greek Helios meaning
        'drawing with the sun'. In 1826, using this process, Niepce took the
        earliest surviving 'photograph'—a view from a window of his house in
        Châlons-sur-Saone which required an exposure of about 8 hours!
