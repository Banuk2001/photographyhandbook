      <h3>Focusing</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The method of modifying the lens to provide the best possible
        resolution, sharpness, and contrast for your chosen subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your lens, which has glass parts inside that can move forward and
        backward to modify the optical path of light, is where focusing normally
        happens with current equipment. The plane of focus will also change if
        you physically move your lens away from the camera, in a similar manner.
        Focusing can be done manually or automatically. When your camera system
        activates a motor to move lens components in order to adjust focus, this
        is known as automatic focus or autofocus. Instead, you must rotate a
        ring or comparable mechanism on the lens to focus manually.

      <h5 class="text-center">Manual focusing</h5>
      <p>
        A manual focus camera in the context of photography is one that requires
        the user to manually focus the lens. All cameras had manually adjustable
        focusing prior to the invention of autofocus, hence the phrase is a
        retronym. Numerous changes can be made to the focus itself. On larger
        view cameras and the like, a focus ring on the lens is frequently spun
        to move the lens elements through a helical screw; on smaller cameras, a
        focus ring on the lens is frequently rotated to move the lens elements.
        Levers on the camera body or the lens are examples of other systems.
        Focus can be chosen in a variety of different ways. The easiest method
        is to measure or estimate the distance to the subject using a distance
        scale. The rangefinder is one more technique.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 class="text-left">Manual focusing step by step.</h5>
      <p>
        1.&nbsp; &nbsp;First, locate the focusing mode switch on your camera or
        lens. It will likely be labeled with “AF/MF,” where “AF” activates&nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; autofocus and “MF” activates manual focus.<br />
        <br />
        2.&nbsp; Then switch your setup to “MF.”<br />
        <br />
        3.&nbsp; Second, find the focus ring, which is often near the middle of
        the lens barrel (if you’re using a prime lens) or near the end of the
        lens barrel (if you’re using a zoom lens).<br />
        <br />
        4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look through your camera viewfinder, then twist the focus
        ring to one side.<br />
        <br />
        5.&nbsp; Now, when you’re in a scenario where manual focusing is
        necessary, you’ll need to simply turn the focus ring until your main
        subject comes into focus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 class="text-center">Auto focusing</h5>
      <p>
        Autofocus (AF) is the function of a camera to automatically focus on a
        subject. Most general digital cameras have this function. There are
        various AF methods, and the available methods are different depending on
        the model of your camera. Use different methods according to the scene
        or subject you want to shoot.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Auto focusing step by step.</h5>
      <p>
        1. Set Lens to AF Mode. The only trick here is to find the AF-MF option
        on your camera lens.<br />
        <br />
        2. Switch Camera to Live View Mode and Zoom in on Subject. <br />
        <br />
        3. Hold the AF-ON Button Until Camera Auto-Focuses
