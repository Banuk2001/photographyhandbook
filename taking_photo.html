        Aim at the area of your frame where the highlights are, this is likely
        to be the sky. Press your shutter to halfway, and the exposure and focus
        will be locked. Now keep your finger at this halfway position. Move your
        camera back to the composed photo you wish to take and press to take
        that photo.

      <p>There are three main steps to follow while taking a photo.</p>

      <h5 class="text-center">Aiming</h5>
      <p>
        Aiming low with your photography doesn't sound like encouragement, but
        good pictures await you at ground level. Perhaps above all else: learn
        how to loiter. Stay relaxed, move slowly, lean on stuff, and wait. Until
        the moment you release the shutter, you're only an observer.

      <p><strong>There are three main steps to Aiming.</strong></p>
      <h6>1. Horizontal</h6>
      <p>
        Standing at the bottom of an elevated ground, with the camera pointing
        towards the higher ground. ground oblique photograph. In this kind of
        photograph, the images closer to the camera are larger than those far
        away.
      </p>
      <h6>2. Vertical</h6>
      <p>
        A vertical photograph is one which has been taken with the camera axis
        directed toward the ground as vertically as possible, while an oblique
        photograph is one which has been taken with the camera axis directed at
        an inclination to the ground.
      </p>
      <h6>3. Angle</h6>
      <p>
        High Angle: The camera is raised above the subject and is tilted down at
        the subject. Low Angle: The camera closer to the ground and points up
        towards the subject. Over the Shoulder: The camera is behind the subject
        as he/she is facing another person. Point of View: The perspective of
        the person in the scene.

      <h5 class="text-center">Focusing</h5>
      <p>
        Focus on photography is the process of making adjustments to the lens to
        find the maximum resolution, sharpness, and contrast for your chosen
        subject. You can do so either using manual focus or the autofocus system
        of your camera.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 class="text-center">Exposing</h5>
      <p>
        Exposure is one of the most fundamental photography terms. When you take
        a picture, you press the shutter button to open a camera's aperture, and
        light streams in, triggering a response from a sensor. Exposure is the
        amount of light that reaches your camera's sensor, creating visual data
        over a period of time.
